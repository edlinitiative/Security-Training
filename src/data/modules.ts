## Why Password Security Matters

Passwords are the first line of defense for every account, system, and piece of data you have access to. A compromised password can give an attacker full access to your email, company files, financial accounts, and more, without any technical hacking required.

### What Makes a Password Weak?

Weak passwords are the most common cause of data breaches. Here's what to avoid:

- Short passwords (fewer than 12 characters)
- Simple words like "password" or "welcome"
- Personal information like your name, birthday, or pet's name
- Reusing the same password across multiple accounts
- Common substitutions like "p@ssw0rd"

### What Makes a Password Strong?

A strong password should be:

- **At least 14 characters long**
- A mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols
- Completely random or a long passphrase (e.g., "BlueMountain!River42")
- Unique, never used anywhere else

!!ILLUS:weak-vs-strong|A weak password can be cracked in seconds. A long, random passphrase takes centuries.

### Password Managers

You should never try to memorize every unique password. Use a trusted password manager instead:

- Password managers generate and store strong, unique passwords for every account
- You only need to remember one strong master password
- EdLight-approved options include 1Password and Bitwarden
- Never store passwords in a browser that is not managed by IT

!!ILLUS:password-manager|One master key unlocks a vault of unique passwords for every account.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Even the strongest password can be stolen. That's why MFA adds a second verification step, like a code sent to your phone, so that even if someone has your password, they still can't get in.

**MFA is required for all EdLight systems.** Enable it immediately on any account that offers it.

!!ILLUS:mfa-flow|MFA requires a second proof of identity, so a stolen password alone is not enough.

### Password Sharing Policy

- Never share your password with anyone, including IT staff
- EdLight IT will never ask for your password
- If you need to give someone access, use permission settings in the relevant system
- If you suspect your password has been compromised, contact fred.pierre-louis@edlight.org

## What Is Phishing?

Phishing is one of the most common and dangerous cyber threats today. It happens when an attacker disguises themselves as a trusted person or organization to trick you into revealing sensitive information, clicking a malicious link, or downloading harmful software.

### Types of Phishing

**Email Phishing**
The attacker sends a fake email that looks like it's from a legitimate source, your bank, Google, a coworker, or even your CEO. The email urges you to act quickly.

**Spear Phishing**
A targeted attack where the attacker researches you specifically. They might mention your name, your team, or a recent project to appear more convincing.

**Smishing (SMS Phishing)**
Phishing attacks sent via text message. Common tactics include fake delivery notifications or "your account has been locked" messages.

**Vishing (Voice Phishing)**
An attacker calls you pretending to be IT support, a bank, or even a government agency.

### How to Recognize a Phishing Email

Be suspicious if an email:

- Creates urgency: "Act now!" or "Your account will be suspended in 24 hours"
- Asks for sensitive information like passwords, credit cards, or Social Security numbers
- Has a sender address that doesn't match the official domain (e.g., support@edlight-help.net instead of @edlight.org)
- Contains typos, odd formatting, or generic greetings like "Dear User"
- Includes unexpected attachments or unfamiliar links
- Asks you to bypass a normal process

!!ILLUS:phishing-email|Anatomy of a phishing email: lookalike domain, urgent language, suspicious link.

### How to Verify Before Clicking

- **Hover over links** before clicking to preview the actual URL
- When in doubt, go directly to the website by typing the URL yourself
- Call the sender through a known phone number to verify
- Forward suspicious emails to security@edlight.org immediately

!!ILLUS:hover-link|Hover (don't click) to reveal the real destination of any link.

### What to Do If You Clicked Something

If you accidentally clicked a suspicious link or entered credentials:

1. Disconnect from the network immediately if possible
2. Report it to fred.pierre-louis@edlight.org
3. Change the password for any account you entered credentials into
4. Do not try to "fix it yourself" — report it right away

!!ILLUS:report-phish|When in doubt, forward suspicious emails straight to Fredler — security@edlight.org.

## Browsing Safely at Work

Every website you visit on a company device can be a potential entry point for risk. Safe browsing means being intentional about which sites you visit, how you interact with web content, and how you protect your data online.

### HTTPS vs HTTP

Always look for **HTTPS** (the padlock icon) in the address bar before entering any information on a website.

- HTTPS encrypts communication between you and the site
- HTTP is unencrypted, anyone on the same network can intercept your data
- A padlock does NOT guarantee a site is trustworthy, it only means the connection is encrypted

!!ILLUS:https-vs-http|HTTPS encrypts the connection, but always double-check the domain too.

### Dangerous Website Indicators

Treat a website with caution if:

- The URL looks unusual (extra characters, misspellings, or added words)
- Your browser shows a security warning, do not ignore it
- It asks you to download software or browser extensions unexpectedly
- It requests sensitive information that seems unnecessary
- Pop-ups appear aggressively or try to prevent you from leaving

### Downloading Files

- Only download files from trusted, verified sources
- Never open unexpected email attachments without verification
- Be cautious of compressed files (.zip, .rar) from unknown sources
- Always run company-approved antivirus scans on downloaded files

### Public Wi-Fi and Corporate Data

**Never access company systems on public Wi-Fi without a VPN.**

Public Wi-Fi networks (hotels, coffee shops, airports) are unencrypted and easily monitored. An attacker on the same network can intercept your traffic, including login credentials and email content.

- Always use the EdLight VPN when working remotely
- Avoid making sensitive transactions (banking, HR, access changes) on public Wi-Fi
- Use your phone's hotspot as an alternative to public Wi-Fi when a VPN is unavailable

!!ILLUS:vpn-tunnel|A VPN wraps your traffic in an encrypted tunnel, even on hostile networks.

### Browser Extensions

Browser extensions can be powerful, but they can also be malicious.

- Only install browser extensions that are approved by IT
- Remove any extensions you no longer use
- Do not install extensions from unofficial sources or pop-up prompts

!!ILLUS:scareware-popup|Scareware pop-ups try to panic you into clicking. Close the tab and report it.

## EdLight Access Policy

Access control is one of the most important pillars of company security. Knowing what access you have, how to use it responsibly, and what to do when something feels wrong will significantly reduce the risk of a breach.

### The Principle of Least Privilege

EdLight follows the **principle of least privilege**, every employee should only have access to the tools, systems, and data they need to do their job. Nothing more.

This limits the damage that can occur if an account is compromised and reduces the risk of accidental data exposure.

!!ILLUS:least-privilege|You only get keys to the rooms your role actually needs.

### Your Access Responsibilities

- You are responsible for all activity performed under your account
- Never share your login credentials with teammates, even for convenience
- Do not use a colleague's account to access something you don't have permission for
- If you believe you need additional access, request it through the IT helpdesk

### Offboarding and Role Changes

When an employee leaves or changes roles:

- Access should be revoked or adjusted immediately
- Administrators are required to report departures or role changes to fred.pierre-louis@edlight.org on the same day
- If you notice a former colleague still has active access, report it to Fredler immediately

### Physical Access

Digital security extends to physical spaces:

- Do not let visitors, contractors, or unauthorized individuals follow you through secured doors (tailgating)
- Lock your workstation whenever you step away, even briefly
- Do not allow others to view your screen in sensitive areas
- Report any physical security concerns to fred.pierre-louis@edlight.org or facility management

!!ILLUS:tailgating|Tailgating: someone slipping through a secured door behind you. Always require a badge.

!!ILLUS:lock-screen|Lock your screen every time you step away — even for a minute.

### Data Classification

EdLight classifies data into three levels:

**Public**, Information that can be shared externally (marketing materials, published announcements)

**Internal**, Information meant for employees only (internal policies, general communications)

**Confidential**, Sensitive information with restricted access (financial data, personal employee data, security configurations)

Never share Confidential data outside of authorized channels. When in doubt, treat it as Confidential.

### Device Management

- Only use company-approved devices to access company systems
- Personal devices may be used only if enrolled in Mobile Device Management (MDM) and approved by IT
- Do not install unauthorized software on company devices
    `,
    keyTakeaways: [
      "You should only have access to systems you need for your job, nothing more.",
      "Never share your credentials or use someone else's account.",

## Securing Your Devices and Networks

Your work devices, laptop, phone, tablet, are gateways to all of EdLight's systems and data. Keeping them secure is one of the most important things you can do as an employee.

### Keep Software Updated

Software updates often contain critical security patches that fix known vulnerabilities. Attackers actively exploit systems that haven't been updated.

- Always install operating system and application updates promptly
- Enable automatic updates where possible
- Do not delay or dismiss security updates
- Contact IT if an update causes issues instead of ignoring it

!!ILLUS:update-shield|Each update closes the doors that attackers are actively trying to walk through.

### Disk Encryption

Every company device must have disk encryption enabled (e.g., FileVault on Mac, BitLocker on Windows). Encryption ensures that if a device is lost or stolen, the data on it cannot be read.

- Verify your device has encryption enabled in system settings
- Report lost or stolen devices to fred.pierre-louis@edlight.org within 1 hour
- IT can remotely wipe a lost device if encryption and MDM are active

!!ILLUS:device-encryption|With disk encryption on, a stolen laptop reveals nothing but scrambled data.

### Physical Device Security

- Never leave your laptop unattended in a public place
- Use a laptop lock when working in shared spaces
- Do not leave a device in a visible location inside your car
- If you must travel with a device, keep it in carry-on luggage, never in checked bags
- Use a privacy screen in public spaces to prevent shoulder surfing

### Network Security

**Company Network**
The office network is managed and monitored by IT. It's the safest place to work from.

**Home Network**
- Use a strong, unique Wi-Fi password, not the default from the router
- Keep your router firmware updated
- Use WPA3 or WPA2 encryption on your home network
- Consider a separate network for smart home devices

**Public Wi-Fi**
- Treat all public networks as untrusted
- Always use the EdLight VPN on public networks
- Avoid accessing sensitive systems unless absolutely necessary

### USB and External Devices

- Never plug an unknown USB drive into a company device
- Attackers plant USB drives in parking lots and public spaces knowing curious people will plug them in
- Only use company-approved external storage devices
- Report any found USB drives to IT, do not plug them in to check what's on them

!!ILLUS:usb-trap|That "Confidential" USB stick in the parking lot is bait. Hand it to IT — never plug it in.

### Antivirus and Endpoint Protection

- Company devices must have IT-managed endpoint protection installed
- Do not disable or bypass security software for any reason
- Report unusual device behavior (slowness, unexpected activity) to fred.pierre-louis@edlight.org immediately
